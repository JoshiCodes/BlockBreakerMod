#### Note: This is one of my first Mods, so it may not be the best. If you have any suggestions, please let me know or open a Issue or Pull Request.

## Usage
It's not hard, really. There are *4 different kind* of Block Breaker. Each can break Blocks like the pickaxe with the same material.
The Blocks start from stone and range up to netherite. The higher the material, the more blocks can be broken and the faster the block breaks.
After placing no further action is required. The Block Breaker will break the block in front of it.
If you sneak and place the Block Breaker, it will look away from you. The Block Breaker can look in all directions.
The Blocks will drop just as if you had broken them with the pickaxe.
